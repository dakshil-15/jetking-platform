 * Records a question the chatbot could not answer from verified Jetking
 * data — the "unanswered-question feedback loop": every refusal is a
 * knowledge-base gap someone can fill, not just a model limitation, but only
 * if it's visible anywhere. Without this, a gate refusal vanished the moment
 * the response was sent.
 *
 * Always logs a structured line to the server console — this alone is
 * immediately useful with zero setup, since Vercel retains function logs
 * (`vercel logs`) and already served as the debugging tool for the
 * OPENAI_API_KEY/Ollama issues earlier in this project's history. When
 * Supabase is configured (see src/lib/supabase.ts — same env vars the admin
 * CMS falls back without), each entry is additionally persisted to an
 * `unanswered_questions` table for a real queryable history — see
 * scripts/unanswered-report.mts and the table's schema in that script's
 * header comment. Never throws: a logging failure must never break the
 * chat response it's attached to.
